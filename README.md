## About 😁
- This is an unofficial result portal developed to ease the process of checking the results.
- Generally, we get results in form of long PDFs which are difficult to read and one can barely calculate the percentage.
- Predicting the ranks is next to impossible thing! This portal serves all these things.
- You get a nice marks presentation, percentage, SGPA, CGPA, and ranks at both college and university levels.
- You can also generate your profile which gives out all the previous semesters' results.
- What's for me in this? Nothing! No ads, no bloatware.
